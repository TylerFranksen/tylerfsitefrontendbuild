                    This project was done with a group of friends when we started getting more familiar with the AWS environment. We wanted to complete a project that would demonstrate our ability to work
                    together as a team in order to have individual goals collaborate towards achieving something greater. We created a website through which the API can receive user-input numbers through
                    path-based URL entry in order to have the website return the number to lambda, have it square the value provided, and then turn around and send that number back to the API as well a saved
                    log sent to RDS. I developed the simple Flask application that would actually interpret a provided response as well as the GitRepositories for this project in order to later setup much 
                    cleaner versioning and logging.

                    My website is meant to be a constant work in progress, so please keep in mind this summary is just for the resume portion of the site.
                    The contents of the webpage are all hosted in an S3 bucket with automated CI/CD deployments for updating/religating versions of the vital file structure within the bucket.
                    This website utilizes Lambda/DynamoDB/JavaScript to count the number of visitors the site has received. In order to achieve this, a Lambda function first requests
                    the contents of a data table hosted in DynamoDB and checks the value for an internal parameter to see the current visit count. The function then adds 1 to the value of the 
                    contained parameter and sends it back to the DynamoDB table, JavaScript is used to find the value within HTML that we are inserting the DynamoDB Visitor Count contents into.
