                            programming, web design, and game design. I have demonstrable skills

                            A group project where we setup a serverless site with an API that received user-input through path-based URLs. Lambda takes the input, 
                            squares its' numerical value, then returns it to the API. A log is saved in RDS for debugging/verifying value. My role was developing 
                            the Git Repositories for versioning & logging, as well as the simple Flask application for calculation.

                            I developed a serverless and automated method to accurately measure firearm ownership in the US. I researched the background check 
                            process and its connection to firearm ownership. By scraping data from the regularly updated NCIS report, I update a DynamoDB table 
                            with attributes for tracking various categories of firearms purchases. The table provides information on the total number of firearms 
                            owned in each category and state, for each month of the year.

                            My website is meant to be a constant work in progress, so please keep in mind this summary is just for the resume portion of the site.
                            The contents of the webpage are all hosted in an S3 bucket with automated CI/CD deployments for updating/religating versions of the vital file structure within the bucket.
                            This website utilizes Lambda/DynamoDB/JavaScript to count the number of visitors the site has received. In order to achieve this, a Lambda function first requests
                            the contents of a data table hosted in DynamoDB and checks the value for an internal parameter to see the current visit count. The function then adds 1 to the value of the 
                            contained parameter and sends it back to the DynamoDB table, JavaScript is used to find the value within HTML that we are inserting the DynamoDB Visitor Count contents into.
                            I have also connected QuickSight to play around with the dashboard in order to gain familiarity later in a professional role.

                            I set up a CloudWatch trigger that whenever the CSV handling FBI Background check ETL pipeline data is updated in DynamoDB, A lambda is triggered to then send an email to targeted
                            recipients via SES. This can be a really helpful tool later when working in group projects or a professional environment to seamlessly keep everyone informed without having to 
                            individually pester them.
