             I am a certified cloud solutions architect that overindulges in learning about
             programming, web design, and game design. I have demonstrable skills
             with teamwork, architecture, and achieving time-sensitive goals based on my
             personal work habits.

        <p class="SqVProjectDesc">
            This project was done with a group of friends when we started getting more familiar with the AWS environment. We wanted to complete a project that would demonstrate our ability to work
            together as a team in order to have individual goals collaborate towards achieving something greater. We created a website through which the API can receive user-input numbers through
            path-based URL entry in order to have the website return the number to lambda, have it square the value provided, and then turn around and send that number back to the API as well a saved
            log sent to RDS. I developed the simple Flask application that would actually interpret a provided response as well as the GitRepositories for this project in order to later setup much 
            cleaner versioning and logging.

        <p class="MySiteProjectYear">2021</p>
        <p class="MySiteProjectDesc">
            I have first quickly drafted this website with some small details that I hope prove I at least subtly know what I
            am doing. This website has separate CI/CD automated deployments for its front and back-ends respectively. This website is also connected internally with AWS services.

        <p class="GSDesc">
            My job at Geek Squad I put on this list because it is the first job Ive had within the IT industry and yet it has significantly bolstered my confidence within it. 
            Working through the pandemic gave me the experience I need to work remotely and yet confidently, coupled with the knowledge I have can manage to help customers fast
            and still efficiently. whether it is operating system environment knowledge or ability to meet customer expectations within a deadline I have found that Geek Squad 
            will have been the first jobs to open my eyes to a lot of these things.
